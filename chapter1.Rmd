## Your first R script

In the script on the right you should type R code to solve the exercises. When you hit the _Submit Answer_ button, every line of code in the script is interpreted and executed by R and you get a message that indicates whether or not your code was correct. The output of your submission is shown in the R console.

You can also execute R commands straight in the console. When you type in the console, your submission will not be checked for correctness! Try, for example, to type in `3 * 4` and hit Enter. R should return `[1] 12`.

*** =instructions
In the script, add another line of code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, and hit the _Submit Answer_ button.

*** =hint
Simply add a line of R code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, just like the example in the sample code!

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
3 + 4
```

*** =solution
```{r}
3 + 4
6 + 12
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_output_contains("18", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to add a line of R code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12.")
success_msg("Awesome! See how the console shows the result of the R code you submitted?")
```


--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1
## Documenting your code

Adding comments to your code is extremely important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about. R makes use of the `#` sign to add comments, just like Twitter!

Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. For example, _Calculate 3 + 4_ in the script on the right is a comment and is ignored during execution.

*** =instructions
Add another comment in the script on the right, _Calculate 6 + 12_, at the appropriate location.

*** =hint
Simply add the line `# Calculate 6 + 12` above the R code that calculates 6 + 12.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4


6 + 12
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6 + 12
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_output_contains("7", incorrect_msg = "Do not remove the code that calculates 3 + 4.")
test_student_typed("# Calculate 3 + 4", not_typed_msg = "Do not remove the comment for the code that calculates 3 + 4.")
test_output_contains("18", incorrect_msg = "Do not remove the code that calculates 6 + 12.")
test_student_typed(c("# Calculate 6 + 12", "# calculate 6 + 12", "#Calculate 6 + 12", "#calculate 6 + 12",
                     "# Calculate 6+12", "# calculate 6+12", "#Calculate 6+12", "#calculate 6+12"), 
                   not_typed_msg = "Make sure to add the comment: `# Calculate 6 + 12`")
success_msg("Great! Looks better, doesn't it?")
```

## R as a calculator

In its most basic form R can be used as a scientific calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Exponentiation: `^`
- Modulo: `%%`

The last two might need some explaining:
- The `^` operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example `3^2` equals 9.
- The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or `5 %% 3` equals 2.

*** =instructions
- Type `2^5` in the script to calculate 2 to the power 5.
- Type `28 %% 6` to calculate 28 modulo 6.
- Click _Submit Answer_ and have a look at the R output in the console.

*** =hint
Another example of the modulo operator: `9 %% 2` equals `1`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Addition
5 + 5 

# Subtraction
5 - 5 

# Multiplication
3 * 5

 # Division
(5 + 5) / 2 

# Exponentiation


# Modulo

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Addition
5 + 5 

# Subtraction
5 - 5 

# Multiplication
3 * 5

 # Division
(5 + 5) / 2 

# Exponentiation
2 ^ 5

# Modulo
28 %% 6
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg <- "Do not remove the examples that have already been coded for you!"
test_output_contains("5 + 5", incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("5 - 5", incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("3 * 5", incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("(5 + 5)/2", incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("2^5", incorrect_msg = "Have another look at the exponentiation. Read the instructions carefully.")
test_output_contains("28 %% 6", incorrect_msg = "Have another look at the use of the `%%` operator. Read the instructions carefully.")
success_msg("Nice one!")
```

## Variable assignment (1)

A variable allows you store a value or an object in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable. You use `<-` to assign a variable:

```
my_variable <- 4
```

Suppose you have a fruit basket with five apples. You want to store the number of apples in a variable with the name `my_apples`. 

*** =instructions
- Using `<-`, assign the value 5 to `my_apples` below the first comment.
- Type `my_apples` below the second comment. This will print out the value of `my_apples`.
- After clicking _Submit Answer_, have a look at the console: the number 5 is printed, so R now links the variable `my_apples` to the value 5.

*** =hint
Remember that if you want to assign a number or an object to a variable in R, you can make use of the assignment operator `<-`. Alternatively, you can use `=`, but `<-` is widely preferred in the R community.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Assign the value 5 to the variable called my_apples


# Print out the value of the variable my_apples

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Assign the value 5 to the variable called my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object("my_apples", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly assigned 5 to `my_apples`? Write `my_apples <- 5` on a new line in the script.")
test_output_contains("my_apples", incorrect_msg = "Have you explicitly told R to print out the `my_apples` variable to the console? Simply type `my_apples` on a new line.")
success_msg("Great! You could also use `=` for variable assignment, but `<-` is typically preferred.")
```

--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1
## Variable assignment (2)

Every tasty fruit basket needs oranges, so you decide to add six oranges. You decide to create the variable `my_oranges` and assign the value 6 to it. Next, you want to calculate how many pieces of fruit you have in total. Since you have given meaningful names to these values, you can now code this in a clear way:

```
my_apples + my_oranges
```

*** =instructions
- Assign to `my_oranges` the value 6.
- Add the variables `my_apples` and `my_oranges` and have R simply print the result.
- Combine the variables `my_apples` and `my_oranges` into a new variable `my_fruit`, which is the total amount of fruits in your fruit basket.

*** =hint
`my_fruit` is just the sum of `my_apples` and `my_oranges`. You can use the `+` operator to sum the two and `<-` to assign that value to the variable `my_fruit`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Assign 5 to my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Assign 6 to my_oranges


# Add my_apples and my_oranges: print the result


# Add my_apples and my_oranges: assign to my_fruit

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Assign 5 to my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Assign 6 to my_oranges
my_oranges <- 6

# Add my_apples and my_oranges: print the result
my_apples + my_oranges

# Add my_apples and my_oranges: assign to my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object("my_apples", incorrect_msg = "Do not change the assignment of the `my_apples` variable!")
test_object("my_oranges")
test_output_contains("my_apples + my_oranges",
                     incorrect_msg = "The output does not contain the result of adding `my_apples` and `my_oranges` (second instruction). Try again.")
test_object("my_fruit")
success_msg("Nice one! The great advantage of doing calculations with variables is reusability. If you just change `my_apples` to equal 12 instead of 5 and rerun the script, `my_fruit` will automatically update as well.")
```


--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1
## The workspace

If you assign a value to a variable, this variable is stored in the workspace. It's the place where all user-defined variables live. The command [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) lists the contents of this workspace. 

```
a <- 1
b <- 2
ls()
```

The first two lines create the variables `a` and `b`. Calling [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) now shows you that `a` and `b` are in the workspace. 

You can also remove variables from the workspace. You do this with [`rm()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/rm). `rm(a)`, for example, would remove `a` from the workspace again. `rm(list = ls())`, which is used in the beginning of your script, clears everything from the workspace.

*** =instructions
- Create a variable, `horses`, equal to 3, and a variable `dogs`, equal to 7.
- List the contents of your workspace with [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) to see that indeed, these two variables are in there.

*** =hint
All you need is a combination of [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) and [`rm()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/rm) at the right time. Give it a try and let the feedback messages guide you.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Clear the entire workspace
rm(list = ls())

# Create the variables horses and dogs


# List the contents of your workspace


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Clear the entire workspace
rm(list = ls())

# Create the variables horses and dogs
horses <- 3
dogs <- 7

# Inspect the contents of the workspace again
ls()
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_student_typed("rm(list = ls())", not_typed_msg = "Do not remove the line `rm(list = ls())`.")
test_object("horses")
test_object("dogs")
test_output_contains('c("dogs", "horses")',
                     incorrect_msg = "Make sure to inspect the objects in your workspace after creating `horses` and `dogs`.")
success_msg("Awesome! You can now build up and inspect your workspace, great!")

--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1
## Discover Basic Data Types

To get started, here are some of R's most basic data types:

- Decimal values like `4.5` are called **numerics**.
- Natural numbers like `4L` are called **integers**. Integers are also numerics.
- Boolean values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) are called **logical**. Capital letters are important here; `true` and `false` are not valid.
- Text (or string) values are called **characters**.

Note how the quotation marks on the right indicate that `"some text"` is a character.

*** =instructions
Change the value of the:
- `my_numeric` variable to `42`.
- `my_character` variable to `"forty-two"`. Note that the quotation marks indicate that `"forty-two"` is a character.
- `my_logical` variable to `FALSE`.

*** =hint 
Replace the values in the script with the values that are provided in the exercise.
```
my_numeric <- 42
```
assigns the value 42 to the variable `my_numeric`. 

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# What is the answer to the universe?
my_numeric <- 42.5

# The quotation marks indicate that the variable is a character
my_character <- "some text"

# Change the value of my_logical
my_logical <- TRUE
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# What is the answer to the universe?
my_numeric <- 42

# The quotation marks indicate that the variable is of type character
my_character <- "forty-two"

# Change the value of my_logical
my_logical <- FALSE
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object("my_numeric", 
            incorrect_msg = "Make sure that you assign the correct value to `my_numeric.`")
test_object("my_character",
            incorrect_msg = paste("Make sure that you assign the correct value to `my_character`.",
                                  "Do not forget the quotes and beware of capitalization! R is case sensitive!"))
test_object("my_logical",
            undefined_msg = "Please make sure to define a variable `my_logical`.",
            incorrect_msg = "Make sure that you assign the correct value to `my_logical`.") 
success_msg("Great work! Continue to the next exercise.")
```

## Back to Apples and Oranges

Common knowledge tells you not to add apples and oranges. But hey, that is what you just did! The `my_apples` and `my_oranges` variables both contained a number in the previous exercise. The `+` operator works with numeric variables in R. 

However, if you try to add a numeric and a character string, R will complain.

*** =instructions
- Click _Submit Answer_ and read the error message. Make sure you understand why this did not work.
- Adjust `my_oranges <- "six"` such that R knows you have 6 oranges and thus a fruit basket with 11 pieces of fruit. Click _Submit Answer_ again.

*** =hint
You have to assign the numeric value `6` to the `my_oranges` variable instead of the character value `"six"`. Notice how the quotation marks are used to indicate that `"six"` is a character.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Assign a value to the variable my_apples and print it out
my_apples <- 5
my_apples       

# Assign a value to the variable my_oranges and print it out
my_oranges <- "six" 
my_oranges 

# New variable that contains the total amount of fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges 
my_fruit
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Assign a value to the variable my_apples and print it out
my_apples <- 5  
my_apples  

# Assign a value to the variable my_oranges and print it out
my_oranges <- 6
my_oranges 

# New variable that contains the total amount of fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges 
my_fruit
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object("my_apples", incorrect_msg = "Don't change the code that assigns 5 to `my_apples`.")
test_object("my_oranges", incorrect_msg = "Change the assignment of the `my_oranges` variable such that the code runs without errors.")
test_object("my_fruit", 
            undefined_msg = "Please make sure to define a variable `my_fruit`.",
            incorrect_msg = "Make sure that you assign the correct value to `my_fruit`.")
test_output_contains("my_fruit", incorrect_msg = "The output does not contain the result of adding `my_apples` and `my_oranges`.")
success_msg("Awesome, keep up the good work!")
```

--- type:MultipleChoiceExercise lang:r xp:50
## What's that data type?

When you added the variables containing `5` and `"six"`, you got an error due to a mismatch in data types. You can avoid such embarrassing situations by checking the data type of a variable beforehand:

```
class(my_var)
```

In the workspace (you can see what it contains by typing [`ls()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/ls) in the console), some variables have already been defined. Which statement concerning these variables are correct?

*** =instructions
- `a`'s class is `integer`, `b` is a `character`, `c` is a `boolean`.
- `a`'s class is `character`, `b` is a `character` as well, `c` is a `logical`.
- `a`'s class is `numeric`, `b` is a `string`, `c` is a `logical`.
- `a`'s class is `numeric`, `b` is a `character`, `c` is a `logical`.

*** =hint
You can find out the data type of the `a` variable for example by typing `class(a)`. You can do similar things for `b` and `c`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
a <- 42
b <- "forty-two"
c <- FALSE
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg1 <- "`boolean` is not the class for logical values. Try again."
msg2 <- "`a` is of the class `numeric`, give it another go."
msg3 <- "`string` is not a class in R. `character` is!"
msg4 <- "Nice one. Let's step it up a notch and start coercing variables!"
test_mc(correct = 4, feedback_msgs = c(msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4))
```

--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1
## Coercion: Taming your data

As Filip explained in the video, coercion to transform your data from one type to another is perfectly possible. Next to the [`class()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/class) function and the `is.*()` functions, you can use the `as.*()` functions to force data to change types.

Take this example:

```
var <- "3"
var_num <- as.numeric(var)
```

`var`, a character string, is converted into a numeric using [`as.numeric()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/numeric). The resulting numeric is stored as `var_num`.

*** =instructions
- Convert `var`, a logical, to a character. Assign to resulting character string to the variable `var_char`.
- Inspect the class of `var_char` by using [`class()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/class) on it.

*** =hints
Use the [`as.character()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/character) function to convert `var` to a character.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Definition of var
var <- TRUE

# Convert var to a character: var_char


# Display the class of var_char


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Definition of var
var <- TRUE

# Convert var to a character: var_char
var_char <- as.character(var)

# Display the class of var_char
class(var_char)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_error()
msg <- "Do not remove or change the definition of the variable `var`."
test_object("var", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_function("as.character", "x",
              not_called_msg = "Make sure to call the function [`as.character()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/character) to convert `var` to a character.",
              incorrect_msg = "Have you passed the correct variable to the function [`as.character()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/character)?")
test_object("var_char")
test_function("class", "x", 
              not_called_msg = "Make sure to call the function [`class()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/class) to inspect the class of `var_char()`.",
              incorrect_msg = "Have you passed the correct variable to the function [`class()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/class)?")
success_msg("Bellissimo!")
```
